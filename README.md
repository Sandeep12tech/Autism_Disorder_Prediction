This project implements a machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict outcomes based on input data. The core algorithm leverages [insert algorithm name â€” e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression] for high accuracy and robust performance. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization are handled using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, while Scikit-learn powers the model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The workflow is designed for reproducibility and scalability, producing interpretable results with clear visual outputs.# Autism_Disorder_Prediction
